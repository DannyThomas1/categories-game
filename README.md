- **Team Formation:** Input all players to be divided into two teams, setting the stage for an epic showdown.
- **Head-to-Head Showdown:** A representative from each team goes head-to-head, ready to outwit their opponent.
- **Category Unveiling:** Anticipation builds as a captivating category illuminates the screen, challenging contestants' knowledge and creativity.
- **Countdown Challenge:** In a daring display of confidence, participants boldly declare the number of items they can list from the category in just 30 seconds, aiming to outshine their rivals.
- **Strategic Bluffing:** Raise the stakes by calling out a bluff! If you sense your adversary might be stretching the truth, challenge them to prove their prowess.
- **Rapid Fire Countdown:** Feel the excitement as the countdown begins, pushing contestants to rapidly list their items within the tight timeframe.
